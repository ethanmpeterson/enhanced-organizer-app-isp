# RSGC Enhanced Organizer ISP

## Overview

The RSGC enhanced organizer app is an IOS application that will assist RSGC students by digitizing their school schedule. The digital schedule allows RSGC students to book appointments and see what classes they will miss while outside of school in various activities. Depending on how long it takes to complete certain features of the app, I may be able to work with the IT department to display grades and other data relevant to an RSGC student.
